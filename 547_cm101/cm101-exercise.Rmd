library(tidyverse)
library(testthat)
```

This worksheet is a condensed version of Jenny's stat545.com functions [part1](http://stat545.com/block011_write-your-own-function-01.html), [part2](http://stat545.com/block011_write-your-own-function-02.html), and [part3](http://stat545.com/block011_write-your-own-function-03.html).

## Syntax Demo

Let's demo the syntax of function-making.

```{r}
square = function(x) x^2 #one way to make a function. diff syntaxes.

#use curly braces for multiple lines: note: R executes and returns the last line of fxn.
square2 = function(x) {
  y = x^2
  y
}


#explicitly say what you want to return: useful if you want to stop early, and R won't return lines below the return function. 
square3 = function(x) {
  y =x^2
  return(y)
}
```

## Motivating example: max minus min.

Find the max minus min of the gapminder life expectancy:

```{r}
?min
?max
max(gapminder$lifeExp) - min(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

Exercise: turn this into a function! i.e., write a function that returns the max minus min of a vector. Try it out on the gapminder variables.

```{r}
max_minus_min <- function(x) {
  max(x)-min(x)
}

max_minus_min(gapminder$lifeExp)
max_minus_min(gapminder$gdpPercap)
```

We'll be building on this. Development philosophy [widely attributed to the Spotify development team](http://blog.fastmonkeys.com/?utm_content=bufferc2d6e&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer):

## Testing

Check your function using your own eyeballs:

- Apply to the vector 1:10. Do you get the intended result?
- Apply to a random uniform vector. Do you get meaningful results?

```{r}
max_minus_min(1:10)

#should return close to 1. 
max_minus_min(runif(100))

?runif()
#generates 100 random uniform variables between 0 and 1. 
#if you take max - min, the more random vars you have, the closer you will get to 0.

```

Let's formalize this testing with the `testthat` package. `expect_*()` functions:

```{r}
#takes 2 args and checks if they are equal within some decimal range.
expect_equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3)

#stronger than expect equal, very strict.

#expect_identical(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3)

#above line will return: "Error: 0.1 + 0.2 not identical to 0.3. Objects equal but not identical""
#expect_true
#expect_less_than... 

```

Add another check to the following unit test, based on the uniform random numbers:

```{r}
#perform a unit test.
#if no error it returns nothing.
#checking here if max_minus_min(1:10) = 9, and it is equal. 
test_that("Simple cases work", {
    expect_equal(max_minus_min(1:10), 9)
    expect_lt(max_minus_min(runif(100)),1) #expect less than 1
})
#nothing returns so we know that simple cases work. 
```

## Try and break your function
see how far it can go, what its limits are 
Because you will eventually forget the function specifics.

```{r}
#numeric vector of length 0 should break it, and it does.
max_minus_min(numeric(0)) 
#try using an entire dataframe
max_minus_min(gapminder)
#enter a factor
max_minus_min(gapminder$country)
```

These don't break!

```{r}
#returns the max-min of all possible values... not really useful.
max_minus_min(gapminder[c('lifeExp', 'gdpPercap', 'pop')])
#coerces T/Fs to 1 and 0, so not really useful. 
max_minus_min(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))
```

We want:
1. Prevent the latter cases from happening, because they return bad/non-useful info and
2. Make a more informative error message in the former, because it throws an error..

Check out `stopifnot` and `stop`:

```{r}
#takes an arg, and if false, if returns error message. 
stopifnot(FALSE)
stop("Here's my little error message.")
```

Your turn:  Use two methods:

1. Using `stopifnot`, modify the max-min function to throw an error if an input is not numeric (the `is.numeric` function is useful).

```{r}
mmm1 <- function(x) {
  #if not numeric, then stop
    stopifnot(!is.numeric(x))
    max(x) - min(x)
}


mm1("hello")
```

2. Using `stop` and an `if` statement, Modify the max-min function to:
    - throw an error if an input is not numeric. In the error message, indicate what's expected as an argument, and what was recieved. 
    - return `NULL` if the input is length-0, with a warning using the `warning` function.

```{r}
mmm2 <- function(x) {
    if (!is.numeric(x)) {
        stop(paste("expecting x to be numeric, input is not numeric, you gave me", 
                   typeof(x)))
    }
    max(x) - min(x)
}

mmm2("hello")
```

Try breaking the function now:

```{r}
mmm1((numeric(0)))
mmm1(gapminder)
mmm1(gapminder$country)
mmm1(gapminder[c('lifeExp', 'gdpPercap', 'pop')])
mmm1(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))

mm2((numeric(0)))
mmm2(gapminder)
mmm2(gapminder$country)
mmm2(gapminder[c('lifeExp', 'gdpPercap', 'pop')])
mmm2(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))
```

## Naming, and generalizing to quantile difference

Let's generalize the function to take the difference in two quantiles:  
- an 0.9 quantile means 90% of time the output will be below that. so we can use this with a random variable. each time you draw a number, there's a 90% chance the draw is less than that quantile number.
- so we take a higher quantile like 0.9 and subtract another number like 0.1

```{r}
#function takes a numeric vector and a vector of probabilities like 0.9 and 0.1.
#takes estimates of these quantiles.

#returns 0.1 and 0.9 quantiles.
quantile(rnorm(100), c(0.1, 0.9))

qd <- function(x, probs) {
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    if (length(x) == 0) {
        warning("You inputted a length-0 x. Expecting length >=1. Returning NULL.")
        return(NULL)
    } 
    qvec <- quantile(x, probs)
    max(qvec) - min(qvec)
}
```

Try it out:

```{r}
x <- runif(100)
qd(x, c(0.25, 0.75))
IQR(x)
qd(x, c(0,1))
mmm2(x)
```

Why did I call the arguments `x` and `probs`? Check out `?quantile`. 

If we input a vector stored in some variable, need that variable be named `x`?

## Defaults

Would be nice to have defaults for `probs`, right? Add them to the below code (which is copied and pasted from above):

```{r}
#add probs = c(0,1) as default
#trying to add an na.rm to be true. 
qd2 <- function(x, probs = c(0,1), na.rm = na.rm) {
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    if (length(x) == 0) {
        warning("You inputted a length-0 x. Expecting length >=1. Returning NULL.")
        return(NULL)
    } 
    qvec <- quantile(x, probs)
    max(qvec) - min(qvec)
}
#can override default values
qd2(rnorm(100), probs =c(0.25,0.75))
qd2(rnorm(100))
```

## NA handling

Does this return what we were expecting?

```{r}
#vector contains 1:10 followed by an NA. how does qd handle this? throws and error.
v <- c(1:10, NA)
qd(v)
```

Notice that `quantile()` has a `na.rm` option. Let's use it in our `qd` function. Modify the code below:

```{r}
qd2 <- function(x, probs=c(0,1)) {
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    if (length(x) == 0) {
        warning("You inputted a length-0 x. Expecting length >=1. Returning NULL.")
        return(NULL)
    } 
    qvec <- quantile(x, probs)
    max(qvec) - min(qvec)
}
```

## Ellipses

There are other arguments to `quantile`, like `type`, that are not used all that much. Put them in as ellipses:

```{r}
#whatever goes into the function, you just add it into the quantile function. that's what the ellipses does.
qd2 <- function(x, probs=c(0,1), na.rm=FALSE, ...) {
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    if (length(x) == 0) {
        warning("You inputted a length-0 x. Expecting length >=1. Returning NULL.")
        return(NULL)
    } 
    qvec <- quantile(x, probs, na.rm = na.rm, ...)
    max(qvec) - min(qvec)
}
v = rnorm(100)
qd2(v)
#returns max - min

#type = 1
#qd2(v,1) will not input 1 as the type argument in function, it will assume that you mean probs = 1 (so it takes probs(1) - probs(1), which = 0)
#
qdv(v, probs = c(0,1) na.rm = TRUE, type = 1)
```
